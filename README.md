# Lung Segmentation from Chest X-Ray

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the process of lung segmentation from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. The notebook utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to segment the lung regions, enabling the extraction of relevant features for further analysis or medical diagnosis.

## Requirements

To run the notebook successfully, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies and avoid conflicts with existing installations.

## Dataset

The notebook assumes that you have a dataset of chest X-ray images available for lung segmentation. Please ensure that the dataset is organized in an appropriate directory structure and each image is labeled accordingly.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lung-segmentation.git](https://github.com/Mdwij/lung-segmentation.git)
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd lung-segmentation
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `Lung_segmentation_from_Chest_X_Ray.ipynb` notebook in your browser.

5. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the images, and perform lung segmentation using the pre-trained CNN model.

6. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to see the results and visualize the segmented lung regions.

## Customization

If you have a different dataset structure or want to experiment with different models or parameters, you can customize the notebook accordingly. Feel free to modify the code and adapt it to your specific requirements.

## Results

The notebook generates segmented lung masks for each input chest X-ray image. You can visualize and analyze the results to gain insights into lung regions and potentially integrate them into other medical image analysis pipelines.
